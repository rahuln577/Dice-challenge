## Code Overview

The JavaScript code for this game consists of three main parts:

2. **CSS (`style.css`):** This file provides the styling for the game elements, ensuring it looks appealing and is easy to use.

3. **JavaScript (`script.js`):** This is the heart of the game logic. It handles player turns, rolling the dice, updating scores, and determining the winner.
